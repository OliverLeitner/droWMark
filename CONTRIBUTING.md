# Contributing

This is a very small project I've made mostly for myself. This means a couple
of interesting things:

- It's flexible: New features could be added easily if requested.
- It's easy to contribute: Just make a pull request, open an issue or whatever
  you prefer.

Being a small project it's not always good. I only develop this plugin during
my free time and, since I'm a freelance, it's very difficult to find free time
for my own coding.

If the plugin have been useful for you and you want to donate to make me keep
developing this kind of stuff, I accept bitcoin but I prefer if you just give
thanks, solve an open issue or give me some ideas/advice.

All the best.
